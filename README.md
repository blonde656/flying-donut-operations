Flying Donut Operations
=======

This is the Flying Donut Operations and Support project. The GitHub repository is used as a public issue tracking system. It is used to track todos, bugs, feature requests, and more from our users.

As issues are created, they'll appear in [Flying Donut](https://www.flying-donut.com/static/#!/project/project-id=519363e1e4b0f8cb1e1b7610) automatically as backlog cards where everything is handled in Scrum prinicipals and methods.

It contains scheduled weekly sprints that handles all issues and bug fixes.

The goal of each iteration is set to resolve the items in priority order. If the team is not able to fix the items at the bottom those items will be moved to the next sprint.

A continuous deployment model is followed. When an card is scheduled to be deployed (or is deployed) it will be marked as "approved" and closed in GitHub.
